+4 wilds can be played at any time, with no other conditions
You do not need to call UNO when playing the penultimate card
The discard pile is shuffled back in as needed

Network packet setup: server -> client
4: [int player_ID, int opponent_count, next player]
5: [int hand count: hand information (comma seperated card values from of #:card (place in handm then the actual card data))] //only part encrypted
6: [for each opponent (ID, cards in hand)]
7: [current top card (int8_t, char) will only send these 4 packets when a play is expected]

8: [done, wait for next turn]

a client would start a game by sending 5 

client -> server
[int resposne_type] 1 = draw, 2 card play, 3 wild card play
[int card number] 2 and 3 only
[char color] 3 only

Typical setup would be (after starting)

Server		Client
4,5,6,7	->		//send playstate
	<-	2	//send card to play
8	->		//done, updated boardstate
